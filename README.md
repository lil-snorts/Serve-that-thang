# Simple Client-Server Communication Example

This project demonstrates a basic client-server communication setup using sockets in C++. The server listens for connections from clients, processes messages to either read or write data, and responds accordingly. This setup includes multi-threading, non-blocking sockets, and basic signal handling for a robust interaction.

---

## Project Structure

- **client.h** and **server.h**: Header files defining the client and server functionalities.
- **logger.h**: Provides logging functions for debugging and informational purposes.
- **main.cpp**: Implements the client-server communication with multi-threading and error handling.

## How It Works

1. **Server**: Listens on port 8080, accepts client connections, and processes commands. It supports:
    - Writing data to a server-stored collection (`WRITE` command).
    - Reading data based on index position (`READ` command).
  
2. **Client**: Connects to the server, reads user input, and sends commands to either write or request data. Runs with two threads:
    - A writer thread sends user-provided input.
    - A reader thread requests and outputs server-stored data periodically.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lil-snorts/Serve-that-thang.git
   ```

2. Compile and run the server:

   ```bash
   g++ server.cpp -o server; ./server
   ```

3. Compile and run the client:

   ```bash
   g++ client.cpp -o client; ./client
   ```

## Usage

The client opens up a console reader and prints out messages that are on the server and sends messages to the server from the user.
The server listens for specific commands from the client. Hereâ€™s how you can interact with it via cURL:

### CURL Requests

The server operates on port `8080` and interprets two commands: `WRITE` and `READ`.

#### 1. Write Data to Server

Send a message to store on the server:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "WYour message here"
```

- **Example**: To write "Hello, Server!", you would run:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "WHello, Server!"
  ```

#### 2. Read Data from Server by Index

Retrieve data stored at a specific index:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "R<index>"
```

- **Example**: To read data at index 0, use:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "R0"
  ```

### Example Interactions

1. **Write Messages**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "WFirst Message"
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "WSecond Message"
   ```

2. **Read Messages**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "R0"
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "R1"
   ```

   or get all messages

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 --data "R"
   ```

## Code Walkthrough

### Client Code

- `main`: Establishes a socket connection to the server and starts two threads:
  - **Reader thread**: Periodically requests data from the server.
  - **Writer thread**: Takes user input and sends it to the server.
- `readFromServer`: Handles reading messages from the server.

### Server Code

- `main`: Sets up a socket listener, accepts client connections, and processes requests in separate threads.
- `handleConnection`: Receives data, determines if it's a `WRITE` or `READ` command, and calls the appropriate handler.
- `handleWrite`: Adds a message to the server's internal data list.
- `handleRead`: Retrieves and sends data back to the client based on the specified index.

## TODOs

### Repository

- [ ] Complete this README with request formats and examples.
- [ ] Implement pipeline tests to automate project testing and ensure stability.

### Server

- [x] Add a `write`/POST function for clients to write to the chat log.
  - [ ] Support larger payloads.
  - [x] Enforce client turn-taking to manage writes.
- [x] Add a `read`/GET function for clients to retrieve chat logs.
- [x] Implement mutexes for concurrent access management.
  - [x] Read requests are mutex-free for faster performance.
  - [x] Write requests are mutex-protected to avoid data race conditions.
- [ ] Enable usernames for message identification.
- [x] Add timestamps for message tracking.
- [ ] Implement message log redundancy and persistence.
- [ ] **Idle Timeout**: Threads should have an idle timeout mechanism to avoid resource wastage.
- [ ] Unit tests

### Client

- [x] Develop a basic client application.
- [x] Auto-update chat log to reflect current messages.
- [x] Parse all entered data as `write` requests.
- [ ] Enable username attachment for chat messages.
- [ ] Enable READ requests for indexes greater than 9
- [ ] Unit tests

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for any enhancements or bug fixes.

## Code Overview

The server code includes a `write` mutex to synchronize client access to the chat log. Each client connection is handled in a separate thread, and the server supports both read and write operations.

### Notable Bugs/Issues

- [x] When clients send requests in quick succession, the socket buffer will store multiple requests and string them together to act like the same message
  - possible fix is suffixing messages with Newlines `\n`
- [x] When clients send a message and the readThread requests for new messages they will be treated as the same message ![alt text](readMeBugSection/image.png)
  - possible fix: server reads from the buffer, parses the messages then services each message.
- [x] client re-requests the initial payload from server.
  - Possible error is the initial setting of the offset?
  - Investigation: the client is sending 2 read requests for offset 0 because it is not waiting for first response. Leading to a doubling of offset
  - Temp solution: add a timed delay after each read call, this will give the server some time to respond.
  - Ideal solution: add redundancy to each call so that if the server send a previous message it wont be duplicated for the client
